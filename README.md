# EZVETERAN-JavaSwingProject
Java Application aims at providing help and assistance to veterans

<b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
Veterans face following problems after they leave Armed Forces:<br>
Relocating, living independently for the first time<br>
No access to adequate mental healthcare<br>
No access to adequate Higher Education<br>
These  major  life  changes  are  challenging  for  military  veterans,  just  as  they  are challenging for anyone. <br>
The challenges associated with these changes are not easily studied or  represented, in  part  because  they  are  not  captured  by medical  diagnoses,  and in  part because it is  difficult  to  draw meaningful lines  between  physiological, psychological,  and social problems. 
Moreover, this stuff of everyday life tends to be overshadowed by veterans’ other,  more  extreme,  experiences  in  combat.<br>
<br>

<b>Solution:</b>
Develop, design and deploy a multi-party organization that can connect the veteran to one or more organizations<br>
Incorporate Medical, Education, Employment & Housing Enterprises.<br> 
Multiple organizations under the said enterprises under which the veteran can apply for training, seek medical help etc<br>
Organizational users can review applications/requests and approve/reject the same - or if required route them to other organizations under a different enterprise
<br>

<b>Features:</b><br>
<b>Ease of Access</b> : User can raise multiple requests, under multiple categories - Medical, Education or Housing. The user can perform all this straight from the User Dashboard
<br>
<b>Real Time Notifications </b>: User is notified of all requests raised, updates to requests raised - in real time via Notifications delivered through Telegram & Email. Telegram’s API and SMTP Protocol has been leveraged to push notifications in real time.
<br>
<b>Real Time Reporting </b> : PowerBI has been leveraged to enable real time reporting. The Sysadmin can view the total number of requests raised, requests pending resolutions etc from a Web Browser or Smartphone
<br>
<b>User Tracking</b> : All Admins can view and track the veteran location using a single click. This has been done by using Google Map’s API
